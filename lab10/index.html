				    <p>for this lab, the goal was to make a button that spat out a string of randomly generated text when pressed.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>problems</h2>
                <div id="problems">
                    <p>i had a brief issue where my button wasn't displaying the text when i pressed it, and at first i thought maybe i had some variables in the wrong places, so i moved the newText variable outside of the button listener function before realizing i had simply mixed up my output class with an id, a mistake i seem to keep making lol. that quick change got the button to work, but i did notice then that the randomly generated text would be the same each time i clicked it unless i reloaded the page. after a quick check in with my partner, i realized the problem was that i had moved the newText variable from the listener function earlier and just needed to put it back. easy peasy!</p>

				<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>this lab went very quickly and easily for me, which was nice, but i also wish i understood a little more about the random text function we were given to use. i can sort of pick it apart and figure out what each line does for the most part, but there's parts of it i don't understand, and i definitely wouldn't have been able to write a function like that myself, at least not without some prior instruction. having a chunk of function i didn't fully understand in my code made this lab a little daunting, so even though it turned out fine and does what the lab requires, i'd like to understand it a little more for future reference.</p>

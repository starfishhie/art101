			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>this lab built upon the previous one and introduced us to compiling variables/data into arrays and objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>i didn't really struggle with this lab! the only brief issues i had were figuring out where to place the spaces in the transport array so that the text would display correctly in the end, as well as a couple commas i forgot to put in the main ride object, but both of those were quickly solved after a short closer inspection of my work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>i don't have much to say about this one! it was pretty simply and smooth for me and was finished pretty quickly! i do worry a little about how i'd fare without clear tutorials and instruction though.</p>
			</div>

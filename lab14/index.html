				<h2>challenge</h2>
                <div id="challenge">
				    <p>for this lab, we were asked to go back over old labs and debug them and/or fix 
                        any errors in our code that kept them from working the way we wanted.</p>

                    <p>this lab was an interesting experience for me, since to be honest i couldn't 
                        really find any bugs or errors in my labs?? i've tended to keep working at 
                        things until i get them right, so there wasn't really much for me to do in 
                        terms of debugging. my biggest struggle was just figuring what i should do for 
                        this lab without any bugs to fix.

				<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>since i couldn't find any mistakes or bugs in my previous labs, i ended up just 
                        adding a little feature that i originally wanted to put in my conditionals lab 
                        but didn't have time to do. i thought this would be better than just doing 
                        nothing and calling myself already perfect lol.
                    </p>

                <h2>results</h2>
                <div id="results">
                    <p>as you can see below, i went back to lab 12 where we worked with conditionals 
                        and added a small feature that i originally wanted to put there in the first 
                        place, but didn't end up having time to do. i used a second function by a 
                        different name that does the same thing as the original name sorting one, but 
                        had it assign an image to correlate with the different results someone could 
                        get. then i just used jquery to add it along with the results when the button 
                        was clicked! it's a small thing, but i think it adds a lot of flavor!</p>

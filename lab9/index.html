                    <p>hey man cmon that's rude i said please :/ whatever since you absolutely must know, this took me a little longer than other labs because i was out of town on the day of the jquery lecture, so i didn't understand things as well as usual. i had a few issues with getting the jquery library to even link properly in the first place since the code originally given to me by the site linked in the slides was different from the code in the instructions, but once i made to switch to the lab-instructions-approved code it started connecting properly. other than that, i mostly just spent a lot of time fiddling with the placement of my div ids, buttons, etc, and trying to figure out how to get different effects to work the way i wanted them to. i worked it out in the end though!</p>

				<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>jokes aside, i had fun with this lab! i like making silly things, and this gave me an excuse to do that. like i mentioned above, it was a little slow starting since i had to teach myself jquery stuff using the slides first, and i pretty much just copied the lab example for one of the buttons so i could familiarize myself with how it worked before i tried making my own, but it wasn't too bad once i figured out how it worked! then it was just a matter of fiddling and tweaking until i got things running smoothly!</p>

				    <p>in this lab, we had to use jquery and ajax to fetch info from an api of our
                        choice and display the results in our lab page.
                    </p>

                <div id="problems">
                    <p>i had to take some time to figure this lab out. i spent a lot of time just 
                        trying to figure out how the pokemon api worked since it contains so much data,
                        and then i had to work out how to use the api to get what i wanted, aka a
                        random pokemon, since it's not a pre-built generator and just stores all the 
                        info. i messsed around a lot in jsbin and had to find a lot of references via
                        google, wesbot, etc, and didn't really know what i was doing half of the time. 
                        eventually, i got things to work by using a random number generator to give me 
                        something to use as a pokemon id number, and then just messed with the api url
                        a little to make it reference the id number and bring up the associated pokemon. 
                        then i just had to fetch the name and image associated with whatever pokemon
                        object got brought up, and bing bam boom there we go!

				<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>i spent a lot of time just trying different things and not fully understanding 
                        what i was doing, but i'm proud of the way i solved my problems and got things
                        working! i had to do a lot of my own problem solving and work out how to make
                        things happen on my own instead of just following step by step instructions, and 
                        i think i did a good job!

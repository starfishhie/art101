			<h1>lab 4 - pseudocoding & problem solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>the goal for this lab was to create a set of instructions/pseudocode in javascript for a simple everyday task and a simple game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>i actually didn't have to much trouble with this one! i took a minute to figure out exactly what the assignment was asking me to do, but i think i matched the spirit of the assignment at the very least! talking to my partner and others in the class about their experiences helped a lot.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>i think i put in an appropriate amount of effort and energy into this lab! i tried to think like a computer would and imagine how my code would be read despite having zero idea how javascript works, and i think i did a pretty decent job with the amount of detail i put in my steps/instructions.</p>

// how to make rosemary bread
  // collect all ingredients
    // 2 tsp active dry yeast
    // 2 tsp sugar
    // 1 cup warm water
    // 1 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra for oiling the bowl and brushing on the bread
    // 2 tbsp dried rosemary
    // 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
    // 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
  // create dough
    // mix yeast, sugar, and 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl
      // let sit for 5 minutes, or until mixture becomes foamy
    // add 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 1/2 tbsp rosemary, all salt, remaining water, and all flour into the same bowl
      // mix until dough forms
    // remove dough from bowl and place on a cutting board dusted with flour
      // knead for 5 to 7 minutes
  // let dough sit and rise
    // coat the inside of another medium to large bowl with olive oil and put the dough in
    // cover bowl with plastic wrap or a towel and leave for 1 to 2 hours, or until dough has doubled in size
      // leaving the dough in a warm-ish environment helps it rise better!
    // remove dough from bowl and put on another floured surface
      // divide it in half and knead each half for 1 to 2 minutes
    // place both dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
    // let dough sit uncovered for another 1 to 2 hours or until doubled in size again
  // bake
    // preheat oven to 400 degrees F
    // take baking sheet with the now doubled-in-size dough balls on it and bake in oven for 10 minutes
    // remove bread from oven, brush olive oil onto the tops, and sprinkle with salt and the remaining rosemary
    // place bread back in oven and bake for another 10 to 12 minutes
    // remove when done and let bread cool slightly before serving
  // enjoy!

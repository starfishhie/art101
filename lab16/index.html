                <div id="challenge">
				    <p>this lab was pretty similar to the previous one, as we were asked to use ajax 
                        to fetch info from an api and display specific data in our html page.
                    </p>

                <h2>problems</h2>
                <div id="problems">
                    <p>i didn't really struggle with the baseline parts of this lab like fetching the 
                        info and displaying it, since i pretty much just copied and adapted the work 
                        i'd done in the previous lab and in the in-class jsbin exercise. i did have an 
                        error show up that wouldn't let me display the data, something about xkcd being 
                        blocked by cors policy? i had no idea what that meant and never seen anything 
                        like it before, so i turned to the internet and wesbot to interpret what that 
                        meant and how to fix it (basically i just had to run the url through another 
                        website). i also had issues when trying to randomize the comic that showed up. 
                        i was able to do it in lab 15 with the pokemon, but i wanted to try and find a 
                        simpler way to do it since i vaguely remembered us doing something like that in 
                        class, but ultimately wasn't able to figure it out. i could probably just do 
                        something similar to my random pokemon code, but i'd have to figure out how to 
                        first fetch data from the api to figure out the most recent comic number, then 
                        change the api accordingly to collect the data i wanted displayed.

				<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>like i said above, i wasn't able to do exactly what i wanted with this lab, 
                        partly due to time constraints. i'm sure i could've figured out a way to 
                        randomize the comic eventually, but with finals right now i had to leave it as 
                        it is right now. other than that and the unexpected cors issue, this went 
                        pretty smoothly!

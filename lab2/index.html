			<h1>hello world!</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<p>my name is rhys muth! i'm a 3rd year art major working towards being a tattoo artist, and i love art, music, video games, animation, and all sorts of stuff like that! i have very little experience with coding or programming outside of a brief high school robotics class, but i feel like i'm learning fairly quickly with not too many issues, and i'm excited to see where i go from here!</p>

					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>the goal of this lab was to work with html and css to make and style a page of our websites.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>i had a hard time styling my page, as i couldn't figure out how to get the lab-specific css file to apply properly, and the site instead kept just defaulting to the site-wide css instead. i chose to just work in the site css file instead of the lab one, and that worked out for me, but i'm still curious about how and why the lab stylesheet wouldn't work the way i thought it would. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>i feel like i did alright with this lab! i ran into a couple issues, but found ways around them and managed to create what i think is a pleasing end product! i definitely plan on asking some questions about page/lab-specific css files at my next opportunity though! </p>
